We propose an approach to automating the process of inventory of representatives of discomycetes and presents the results of using prototypes of programs of this technological cycle, confirming the possibility of detecting the presence of fruit bodies of discomycetes in photographs taken in the natural habitat.
Here we studied the possibility of automating this detection process using a neural network prototype.
Thus, the obtained results confirmed the hypothesis that normalized scaled histograms of the color distribution of image fragments can be used as key features for determining the presence of discomycetes in the image. In addition, an assumption was made about the possibility of automating both the identification process and, in the future, the classification of discomycetes using machine learning tools with the accumulation of a sufficient amount of material.
The testing set for the NN is Test.xlst, training one is Train.xlsx. You can create your own samples using the code in /Preprocessing.
